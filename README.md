# Rodinia Improvement Proposals (RIPs)

Rodinia Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe features for the Rodinia wallet.

## Project Goal

The Rodinia Improvement Proposals repository exists as an open place for everyone in the community to propose their ideas for the platform. We believe the community should participate in the development of the wallet. This way, we can get one step closer to true decentralization together.
